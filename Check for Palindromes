/*You mentioned Free Code Camp. What other resources would you suggest for those interested in pursuing engineering?
There are a lot of free resources online. I think Codecademy provides a good introduction into coding, and gives you a good idea into whether you like it or not, because usually people will switch to this career as they think “I’m going to earn lots of money if I switch to IT”.
So they go through Codecademy and their HTML and CSS tracks which are quite easy, but then when they switch to JavaScript, Python, Ruby and all those languages, they realise it’s more difficult than they originally thought.
So Codecademy is a good place to start, but if you’re serious about coding then I’d recommend Free Code Camp (for learning JavaScript, Node.js, React), the Odin Project (for learning Ruby) or getting a subscription on Treehouse or Pluralsight — they give you more advanced classes. Also, if you’re interested in taking some MOOC, you can have a look at edX or Coursera.
What advice would you give to anyone wanting to follow in your footsteps?
I would say: if you’re passionate, set goals and be really disciplined. So if you want to learn coding, just start with 30 minutes a day. It’s important to do it regularly, your brain is like a muscle, it needs to exercise every day.
You can also join meetups, as it’s essential you meet people with the same mindset — you don’t want to be on your own and struggling, because other people will be facing the same challenges.
Most importantly, listen to your passion and don’t listen to others — if some people tell you “no, this is silly, you can’t change careers,” ignore them.
If you have the passion, do it, because it really is worth it.*/
