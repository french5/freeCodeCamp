for (var x = 0; x < contacts.length; x++){
    if (contacts[x].firstName === firstName) {
        if (contacts[x].hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            return contacts[x][prop];
        } else {
            return "No such property";
        }
    }
}
return "No such contact";
Code Explanation:

The for loop runs, starting at the first object in the contacts list.
If the firstName parameter passed into the function matches the value of the "firstName" key in the first object, the if statement passes.
Then, we use .hasOwnProperty() method (checks if there's a given property and returns a boolean) with prop as an argument. If it's true, the value of prop is returned.
If the second if statement fails, No such property is returned.
If the first if statement fails, the for loop continues on to the next object in the contacts list.
If the firstName parameter isn't matched by the final contacts object, the for loop exits and No such contact is returned.


var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 5;
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myCar = new Car();
myCar.nickname = "hourglass23";

var Car = function(wheels, seats, engines) {
  //Change this constructor
  this.wheels = wheels;
  this.seats = seats;
  this.engines = engines;
};

//Try it out here
var myCar = new Car(4,4,2);
